# Contributing Guidelines
This is a template. Guidelines posted here may not be applicable to all repos.
### First and Foremost
- GitHub Copilot and other generative AI coding agents are **strictly forbidden.**
### Bug Reporting
- Is it a security vulnerability? Check the posted security policy if there is one, otherwise reach out to me privately.
- Make sure the bug hasn't already been reported before opening an issue.
- Provide a clear title and description and as much relevant information as possible.
- If you're fixing a bug posted by someone else, feel free to let them know if you want it assigned to you.
- **Do not assign issues to AI.**
### Pull Requests
- Files protected by `CODEOWNERS` are sensitive and usually off limits. Ask the designated owner (usually me) before making any changes.
- Ensure your PR description clearly describes the changes. If you're working on something with an open issue, include the issue number.
- **Do not pull request anything generated by AI.**
### Questions?
- Feel free to post in the Q&A section in the discussions. If the repo doesn't have it enabled for some reason, [use this one](https://github.com/dandykong/dandykong/discussions).
- **Do not use AI as a writing tool.**
